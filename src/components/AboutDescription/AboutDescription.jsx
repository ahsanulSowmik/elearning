<p  className="serviceDescription">
Daffodil International University has a good number of clubs, providing opportunities for students to perform
extra-curricular activities, which help them to exercise their talents beyond classroom boundary and develop 
leadership and collaboration skills. 

<br></br><br></br>
Every club is supervised by a Moderator, who engages students in various programs on a regular basis, 
training them in discipline, teamwork and event management. Each club is run by an executive committee that makes 
decisions on all club functions. The duration of a club committee is usually one year, after which a new committee 
is formed. Any student of DIU willing to join a club should contact the concerned club officials, fill up a form and get registered.

The club activities are regulated, monitored and assessed by a higher body in the university and top activists/performers are recognized and rewarded
